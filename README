#ProgrammersNotebook (Working Title)

I save or look up many tasks in programming. From shell scripting to exporting/importing databases. I have used different ways of saving these snippets. Most served their purpose; save some text for later. I wanted to find these snippets quicker and needed a application to play with MongoDB some more, so I wrote ProgrammersNotebook to capture these snippets, and allow me to find them _fast_.

I plan on adding screenshots and instructions for installing locally soon if you want to get a version up and running locally. The only dependencies currently are:
